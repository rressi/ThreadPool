# ThreadPool
This a reference implementation of the Thread Pool design pattern.

The implementation satisfy the following requirements:
- Easily portable over different platforms.
- Baseline, didactical and clean implementation (no exoteric extras).
- Use of C++11 shared pointers and syntax although can be easily back-ported to non-C++ compilers.
- Fast and efficient.
- No external dependencies, just pure C/C++.

Implemented platforms:
- Posix (Linux, OSX, Unix...).
